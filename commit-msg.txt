feat: add artifact staging layer with manifest lifecycle tracking

Introduce a three-phase generation pipeline (artifacts -> workflows -> outputs)
to replace direct writes to outputs/, which caused IDE gitignore conflicts.

New files:
- schema/manifest.schema.json - JSON Schema for the manifest control plane
- skills/generate-manifest.md - teaches agents to init/update manifest.json
- skills/promote-workflow.md - validation checklist and promotion process
- artifacts/.gitkeep + artifacts/.gitignore - scaffold staging root

Modified:
- workflow-creator/workflow.yaml (v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0)
  - Add init step: creates artifacts/{name}/{run_id}/ and manifest.json
  - Redirect all produces: paths to artifacts staging directory
  - Add promote step: validates, assembles, archives, writes workflow_status.json
- scripts/ide/register.sh
  - Accept artifact run dir as argument or auto-detect from artifacts/
  - Read workflow name and run_id from manifest.json
  - Support both individual files and ##FILE:## bundle format
  - Archive run to outputs/{name}/{run_id}/build/ post-promotion
  - Update manifest status to "registered" via jq
- SPEC.md - document artifacts/, manifest.json, workflow_status.json as spec
- .gitignore - gitignore artifact run dirs, track staging root

The run_id (YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS) scopes each generation attempt, enabling
parallel runs, rollback, and full provenance tracing from registered workflow
back to its originating build.
