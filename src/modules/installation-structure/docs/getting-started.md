# Getting Started with Installation Structure Enhancement

Welcome to installation-structure! This guide will help you get up and running.

## What This Module Does

The Installation Structure Enhancement provides zero-clutter agentfile integration using invisible `.agentfile/` directory organization. It transforms agentfile from a tool that pollutes project roots into a professional-grade framework enhancement that respects developer workflows and project organization.

## Installation

If you haven't installed the module yet:

```bash
bmad install installation-structure
```

Follow the prompts to configure the module for your needs.

## First Steps

**For New Projects:**
1. Choose "clean" installation mode during setup
2. Your project root stays perfectly clean with only `agentfile.yaml` visible
3. All agentfile functionality lives in the invisible `.agentfile/` directory

**For Existing Installations:**
1. Choose migration analysis to assess your current setup
2. Sam (Migration Specialist) will create a safe migration plan
3. Execute migration with automatic backup and rollback capabilities
