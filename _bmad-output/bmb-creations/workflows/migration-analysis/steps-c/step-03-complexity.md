# Step 3: Assess Migration Complexity

## STEP GOAL

Evaluate migration difficulty and identify potential risks.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES

1. **Evaluate complexity** - How complex is the migration?
2. **Identify risks** - What could go wrong?
3. **Estimate effort** - How long will migration take?

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

- Preparation
- Migration execution
- Validation
- Rollback if needed

## OUTPUT

Risk assessment with complexity rating.
