# Review Summarization Skill

## Purpose
Distill detailed code review findings into a concise, actionable summary for quick consumption.

## Summarization Process

### 1. Priority Assessment
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, bugs, breaking changes
- **High**: Performance issues, major maintainability problems
- **Medium**: Style violations, documentation gaps
- **Low**: Minor suggestions, nice-to-have improvements

### 2. Content Extraction
- Identify must-fix issues immediately
- Extract high-impact improvement opportunities
- Note quick wins (easy fixes, high value)
- Highlight well-implemented solutions
- Compile actionable next steps

### 3. Formatting Strategy
- Use emoji for visual scanning
- Keep descriptions under 2 sentences
- Include specific file/line references
- Provide clear priority ordering
- Focus on actionable outcomes
