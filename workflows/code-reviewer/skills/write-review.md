# Code Review Writing Skill

## Purpose
Transform technical analysis into clear, constructive, and actionable code review feedback.

## Review Writing Process

### 1. Structure Planning
- Organize findings by severity and category
- Plan logical flow from critical to minor issues
- Balance criticism with positive feedback
- Consider audience (junior vs senior developers)

### 2. Content Development
- **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview
- **Critical Issues**: Security, bugs, breaking changes
- **Important Improvements**: Performance, maintainability
- **Suggestions**: Style, documentation, minor enhancements
- **Positive Feedback**: Well-implemented solutions

### 3. Communication Best Practices
- Use clear, non-technical language where possible
- Explain the "why" behind each recommendation
- Provide specific code examples and alternatives
- Suggest learning resources for complex topics
- Maintain supportive, educational tone

### 4. Actionable Recommendations
- Provide step-by-step fix instructions
- Include before/after code examples
- Suggest testing approaches
- Reference relevant documentation
- Consider implementation effort vs benefit

## Review Format

### Issue Template
```
**[Severity] Issue Title**
- **Location**: file.js:line
- **Problem**: Clear description of the issue
- **Impact**: Why this matters
- **Solution**: Specific fix recommendation
- **Example**: Code snippet showing the fix
```

### Positive Feedback Template
```
**✅ Good Practice**: [Specific achievement]
- **Why it works**: Explanation of the good approach
- **Benefits**: Positive impact on the codebase
```

## Guidelines
- Start with positive feedback when possible
- Group related issues together
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Provide multiple solution options for complex issues
- End with a clear summary of action items
- Keep reviews focused and scannable
