# Code Analysis Skill

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive technical analysis of code to identify issues and improvement opportunities.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Understand code purpose and context
- Identify language, framework, and patterns used
- Review dependencies and external integrations

### 2. Systematic Review
- **Logic Flow**: Trace execution paths and edge cases
- **Data Handling**: Input validation, sanitization, type safety
- **Error Management**: Exception handling, error propagation
- **Resource Management**: Memory, connections, file handles
- **Concurrency**: Thread safety, race conditions, deadlocks

### 3. Security Analysis
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Data exposure and privacy issues
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Dependency security

### 4. Performance Evaluation
- Algorithmic complexity analysis
- Resource usage patterns
- Scalability considerations
- Database query efficiency
- Caching strategies

### 5. Code Quality
- Style guide compliance
- Naming conventions
- Code duplication
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage gaps

## Output Structure
- **Issue Summary**: Brief overview of findings
- **Detailed Issues**: Categorized by severity and type
- **Code Locations**: Specific file and line references
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential consequences
- **Technical Recommendations**: Solution approaches

## Guidelines
- Be objective and evidence-based
- Provide specific examples
- Consider both immediate and long-term implications
- Suggest concrete improvement steps
- Prioritize by risk and impact
