# Skill: Explain

## Purpose
Teach the agent how to write a single, focused explanatory paragraph about any topic.

## Instructions

1. Identify the core idea — what is this thing fundamentally?
2. Identify who uses it and why
3. Write one paragraph that answers: what is it, why does it exist, and when would a developer reach for it?

## Examples

**Topic:** `git rebase`
**Good:** Git rebase is a way to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit, effectively rewriting the project history. Unlike merging — which creates a new commit that joins two branches — rebasing replays your commits on top of another branch, producing a cleaner, linear history. Developers use it to keep feature branches up to date with main without merge commits cluttering the log.

**Bad:** Git rebase is a git command. It is used for rebasing. You can rebase branches with it.
